### A Secure Network of Trusted Relationships in Dangerous Contexts

---

## ✨ Overview

**Christchain** is a secure discipleship networking app for Muslim-background believers in high-risk regions. Designed for use by Online Missionaries (OMs) and their spiritually ready disciples, this platform facilitates safe, trust-based, and biometric-secured connections—empowering local believers to form fellowship, grow together, and eventually multiply.

---

## 🚀 What Problem Does It Solve?

Thousands are coming to Christ online, yet many remain **isolated**, unable to safely connect with other believers. Traditional digital tools are not built for **trust, risk evaluation, or secure local networking**. Christchain bridges this gap, helping to **build the underground Church** in a highly secure and relationship-based way.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 🔐 For Online Missionaries (OMs)

* **Invite** disciples via one-time access codes
* **Fill in** disciples’ metadata: location, language, dialect, spiritual level, and trust score
* **Dashboard** shows network health, disciple connections, and risk evaluations
* **Moderate** the network by removing disciples with high-risk profiles

### 📱 For Disciples (Seekers)

* **Join** via one-time code and biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID)
* **View** dynamic trust-based network map with circles representing potential local connections
* **Interact** with others via:

  * Secure chat
  * Trust score sliders
  * Relationship-type tagging (None, Virtual, In-person)
* **Visual Map Indicators**:

  * **Color** = Risk level
  * **Connection Line** = Type of relationship (None, Virtual, In-person)
  * **Line Thickness** = Trust level
  * **Circle Size** = Duration known

---

## 💡 Innovation & Features

* **Blockchain-ready architecture** for immutable trust scoring (future scope)
* **Biometric login** and pseudonymized profiles for total anonymity
* **Visual Trust Mapping UI**—a novel way to explore and vet new connections
* **Covert onboarding mechanism** via one-time code entry disguised in-app

---

## 📈 Impact & Vision

Christchain is more than a product—it's a **movement catalyst**. As believers begin to form trust-based fellowships locally, this platform facilitates:

* Secure multiplication of **indigenous fellowships**
* Foundations for a **relational Church in unreached contexts**
* **True disciple-making movements** (DMMs), not just digital conversions

---

## 📊 Judging Criteria Highlights

* **Product/Concept**: Addresses digital discipleship isolation with a secure, practical, and scalable solution.
